    authors: Zhenyu Tang*, Chaoran Feng*, Xinhua Cheng, Wangbo Yu, Junwu Zhang, Yuan Liuâ€ , Xiaoxiao Long, Wenping Wang, Li Yuanâ€ 
    project_short: 3D Compression
    date: ðŸ”¥ Sep., 2024. ~ Nov., 2024ðŸ”¥
    project:  The project is abouta novel framework that effectively adopts the neural field representation to encode the attributes of 3D Gaussians with multiple tiny MLPs, only requiring a small model size even for a large-scale scene.

  - title: NOFA++:Tuning-free NeRF-based One-shot Facial Avatar Reconstruction
    authors: Wangbo Yu, Chaoran Feng, Yanbo Fanâ€ , Yong Zhang, Xuan Wang, Fei Yin, Yunpeng Bai, Baoyuan Wu, Yan-Pei Cao, Li Yuanâ€ , and Yonghong Tianâ€ 
    project_short: 3D Facial Avatar
    date: ðŸ”¥ Oct. 2024ðŸ”¥
    project:  We propose a generalizable one-shot 3D facial avatar reconstruction framework that leverages a pretrained 3D GAN and a coarse-to-fine strategy to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction and dynamic reenactment from a single source image without test-time finetuning.
