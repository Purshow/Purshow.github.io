  - title: NOFA++:Tuning-free NeRF-based One-shot Facial Avatar Reconstruction
    authors: Wangbo Yu, Chaoran Feng, Yanbo Fanâ€ , Yong Zhang, Xuan Wang, Fei Yin, Yunpeng Bai, Baoyuan Wu, Yan-Pei Cao, Li Yuanâ€ , and Yonghong Tianâ€ 
    project_short: 3D Facial Avatar
    date: ðŸ”¥ Oct. 2024ðŸ”¥
    project:  We propose a generalizable one-shot 3D facial avatar reconstruction framework that leverages a pretrained 3D GAN and a coarse-to-fine strategy to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction and dynamic reenactment from a single source image without test-time finetuning.
