<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Biography</h2>
I am currently a master student of Computer Science in [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/),working under the mentorship of [Dr.Yuan](https://yuanli2333.github.io/) and this is the [homepage](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup)of my group.Prior to this, I pursued my undergraduate studies at the School of Future Technology, [Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn/), majoring in Artificial Intelligence. My GPA was 3.8/4.0, ranking first out of 85 in my major and overall.I was awarded the National Scholarship for three consecutive years.Nowadays, My research involves 3D reconstruction for large scale scene and sparse views,3D generation,SLAM,and spiking neural network.

## Award
- **Nation Scholarship**.
- **Qubochuan Scholarship**, *highest scholarship of DUT, awarded to only 10 recipients each year*.
- **First prize in the China Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Competition**.

## Research Interest:

- **Computer Graphic:** 3D Reconstruction(NeRF,Gaussian Splatting),3D Generation(DreamFusion...)
- **SLAM:** Path planning of robots(Fast-Planner,Far-Planner,Ego-planner and so on).
- **Spiking Neural Network:** Vision tasks using SNN like classification,segmentaion and so on.
