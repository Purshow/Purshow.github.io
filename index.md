<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Biography</h2>
I am currently a master student of Computer Science in [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), working under the mentorship of [Dr.Yuan](https://yuanli2333.github.io/) and this is the [homepage](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup) of my group.Prior to this, I pursued my undergraduate studies at the School of Future Technology, [Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn/), majoring in Artificial Intelligence. My GPA was 3.8/4.0, ranking 1/85 in my major scores and overall scores. I was awarded the National Scholarship for three consecutive years. Nowadays, My research involves 3D Vision(3D/4D Reconstruction, 3D/4D Generation), neuromorphic cameras and spiking neural network.

## Award
- **Nation Scholarship**.
- **Qubochuan Scholarship**, *highest scholarship of DUT, awarded to only 10 recipients each year*.
- **First prize in the China Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Competition**.

## Research Interest:

- **Computer Graphics:** 3D Vision, 3D Reconstruction(NeRF,Gaussian Splatting), 3D Generation(DreamFusion...)
- **SLAM:** Path planning of robots(Fast-Planner, Far-Planner, Ego-planner and so on).
- **Spiking Neural Network and Neuromorphic Cameras:** 3D Vision tasks using SNN from neuromorphic cameras(event camera, spiking camera).

## Service

- **ðŸ’¡Conference reviewer**: NeurIPS 2024, ACM MM 2024, ICLR 2025, CVPR 2025
