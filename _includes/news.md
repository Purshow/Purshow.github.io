<ul>
<li><strong>[Dec. 11, 2024]</strong> 🥳🥳🥳 My work, AE-NeRF and Cycle3D are accepted by Proceedings of the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, welcome to follow my work.</li>
<li><strong>[Nov. 15, 2024]</strong> 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️ The latest project, NeuralGS,  a novel framework that effectively adopts the neural field representation to encode the attributes of 3D Gaussians with multiple tiny MLPs, only requiring a small model size even for a large-scale scene. 🚀✨ </li>
<li><strong>[August 20, 2024]</strong> 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️ The latest project, AE-NeRF, has been completed and updated. We propose the robust and efficient pipeline to reconstruct 3D scenes with pure event stream followed by noisy poses in unbounded and complex environments. 🚀✨ </li>
<li><strong>[July 31, 2024]</strong> 💪💪💪  The latest project, Cycle3D, has been completed and updated. First work followed by Zhenyu Tang in 3D Generation.Check it out now for the latest improvements and features! 🚀✨ </li>
<li><strong>[May 30, 2024]</strong> 🔊🔊🔊 The latest project, EvaGaussians, has been completed and updated. Check it out now for the latest improvements and features! 🚀✨ </li>
<li><strong>[May 8, 2024]</strong> 📣📣📣 The web of my profile has been now established, welcome 🥳🥳🥳!</li>
